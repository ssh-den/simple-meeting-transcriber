# Parameters for audio segmentation:
# Minimum silence duration (in ms) that is considered a boundary between segments.

# You can explicitly specify a value, for example, -40.

# Parameters for parallel processing:
# Number of threads for parallel segment transcription.

# - temperature: initial temperature value (0.0 â€“ 1.0). A higher temperature may help
#   if the text is too monotonous, but too high a value may reduce stability.
temperature = 0.0

# - temperature_inc: temperature increment in case of fallback during decoding.

# - best_of: number of top candidates among which the result is chosen.
#   Increasing this value may improve quality, but will slow down processing.

# - beam_size: beam search width. A higher value may improve quality,
#   but requires more computational resources.
